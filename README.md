Lights Open
===========

Lights Open simulates a game of Lights Out, a 1995 game by Tiger Toys. [1]

Players are able to toggle grid squares by left-clicking on the desired square.

Right-clicking anywhere on the grid rolls back the last move.

To run, simply use `make` to build a `.jar` file and start playing.

Several sample state files are included in the top level directory `./state`.

Finding their solutions, if they exist, is left as an exercise for the reader.
